BiwaTuples
==========

This is tuplespace implementation in Scheme 
(server-side: Gauche, client-side: BiwaScheme).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_space

BiwaTuples provides tuplespace which can be accessed
from browsers for inter-browser communication.

* (ts-init) : initialize
* (ts-write '(a b c)) : put a tuple on the server
* (ts-take '(a _ _)) : remove a tuple starts from 'a
  * If there is no such tuple, waits until a matching tuple is put
* (ts-takep '(a _ _)) : 
  * Like ts-take, but returns #f immediately when no tuple is found
* (ts-read '(a _ _)) :
  * Like ts-take, but does not remove the tuple from server
* (ts-readp '(a _ _)) :
  * Like ts-read and non-blocking

Since ts-take/ts-read "blocks" until a matching tuple is found,
you can write client-side programs in imperative way,
rather than callback style.

See chat.html or ttt.html for example.

Requirements
------------

* Gauche (http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/)
  * eg. '$ brew install gauche' on Mac with Homebrew
* ../lib/biwascheme.js
  * type 'make' to rebuild it

Demo1: chat
-----------

1. Start server

  $ gosh chat_server.scm

2. Open http://localhost:9999/chat.html in two browsers
  (or open http://localhost:9999/chats.html , which emulates
  three clients in a browser)

3. Post some message and it will displayed immediately on
  other browsers.

Demo2: Tic Tac Toe
------------------

1. Start server

  $ gosh ttt_server.scm

2. Open http://localhost:9999/ttt.html in two browsers
  (or open http://localhost:9999/ttts.html in a browser)

3. Choose a cell and click the button.

4. (Note that no message is shown when game ends :-P)
